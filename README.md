# PrismMahAppsSample

Sample for a modular application based on the PRISM-Library and the MahApps.Metro toolkit for creating metro-styled, modern UI WPF applications.

Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in WPF. Prism provides an implementation of a collection of design patterns that are helpful in writing well structured and maintainable XAML applications, including MVVM, dependency injection, commands, EventAggregator, and others. More informations about the PRISM-Framework can be found here: [https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism] (https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism)

MahApps.Metro is a toolkit for creating Metro / Modern UI styled WPF apps. The toolkit contains styles for all common controls (like Buttons, TextBoxes, TabControl). The toolkit can be found here: [https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro] (https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro)

The example application shows the combination of these two libraries with PRISM-Regions, Modules, Commands, Flyouts, Tiles and so on. Here's a screenshot of the main dialog:
